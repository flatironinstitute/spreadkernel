This software is heavily derived from the 'finufft' library

https://github.com/flatironinstitute/finufft

and follows the same licensing.

The code here is essentially a hard fork of the spreader used there.  Therefore
any code contributions there also follow here. Major contributions to the code
from which this project is derived are largely attributed to

* Alex Barnett - finufft maintainer/creator and general numerical guru
* Robert Blackwell - atomic OMP add_wrapped_subgrid, and creating this project
* Jeremy Magland - early multithreaded spreader
* Ludvig af Klinteberg - SIMD vectorization/acceleration of spreader
* Melody Shih - Re-organization of spreader components
* Libin Lu - SIMD kernel
* Marco Barbone - SIMD kernel manual vectorization
* Wenda Zhou - SIMD ideas, and SIMD code I hope to incorporate
* Martin Reinecke - SIMD kernel and interp auto-vectorization, binsort
